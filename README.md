# Random-Quote-Generator

Displays random quotes using javascript.

In this project, you'll create an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. You can display a quote from a famous athlete, politician, or historical figure:

"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." â€” Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, including variables, loops and object literals, to complete this project.

To help you get started, we'll give you basic HTML and CSS, as well a JavaScript file containing some starter code. But you'll have to find the quotes yourself and build the data structure to store them in.

## Instructions 

Open up `index.html` in your browser to view the project. Edit the script file in `js/script.js` to dynamically print the random quotes.

Create a function called printQuote that inserts a new quote into the div with the id `quote-box`;

For extra marks, change the background colour everytime the button is clicked.

Each quote should include the quote, source, citation, year and tags.
